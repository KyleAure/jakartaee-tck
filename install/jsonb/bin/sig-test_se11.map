# IMPORTANT:  this sig-test.map file for use with JDK 11+ only!
#             Using this file with older version of JDK will yield errors.
#
# The signature test mapping file for the JSON-B TCK.  This file
# should be formatted as a standard java properties file.  The
# name is the package name and the value is the version of the
# package that should be tested by the signature tests.
#
# The resultant signature file name has a name that complies
# with the following format:
# <package>.sig_<technology_version>_<JavaSE_version_these_work_with>
# Given this format, the following example breaks down as follows:
#    jakarta.json.bind.sig_1.0_se11:
#      <package> = jakarta.json.bind
#      <technology_version> = 1.1  (for JSON-B) 
#      <JavaSE_version_these_work_with> = se11
#
# For this release valid versions are:  "_se11"
# This sig-test.map file is designed to be run using JDK 11 so any
# signature file that ends with "_se11" will be valid.
