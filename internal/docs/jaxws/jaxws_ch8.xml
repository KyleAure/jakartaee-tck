Conformance Requirement (Standard binding declarations): The https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jaxws namespace is reserved for standard JAX-WS binding declarations. Implementations MUST support all standard JAX-WS binding declarations. Implementation-specific binding declaration extensions MUST NOT use the https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jaxws namespace.

Conformance Requirement (Binding language extensibility): Implementations MUST ignore unknown elements and attributes appearing inside a binding declaration whose namespace name is not the one specified in the standard, i.e. https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jaxws.

8.3 Embedded Binding Declarations An embedded binding declaration is specified by using the jaxws:bindings element as a WSDL extension. Embedded binding declarations MAY appear on any of the elements in the WSDL 1.1 namespace that accept extension elements, per the schema for the WSDL 1.1 namespace as amended by the WS-I Basic Profile 1.1[17].

8.4 External Binding File The jaxws:bindings element MAY appear as the root element of a XML document. Such a document is called an external binding file.

Conformance (Multiple binding files): Implementations MUST support specifying any number of external JAX-WS and JAXB binding files for processing in conjunction with at least one WSDL document.

8.5 Using JAXB Binding Declarations It is possible to use JAXB binding declarations in conjunction with JAX-WS.  The JAXB 2.0 bindings element, henceforth referred to as jaxb:bindings, MAY appear as an annotation inside a schema document embedded in a WSDL document, i.e. as a descendant of a xs:schema element whose parent is the wsdl:types element. It affects the data binding as specified by JAXB 2.0. Additionally, jaxb:bindings MAY appear inside a JAX-WS external binding file as a child of a jaxws:bindings element whose node attribute points to a xs:schema element inside a WSDL document. When the schema is processed, the outcome MUST be as if the jaxb:bindings element was inlined inside the schema document as an annotation on the schema component. While processing a JAXB binding declaration (i.e. a jaxb:bindings element) for a schema document embedded inside a WSDL document, all XPath expressions that appear inside it MUST be interpreted as if the containing xs:schema element was the root of a standalone schema document.
